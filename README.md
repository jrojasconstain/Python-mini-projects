# Python-mini-projects
Exploring Python with mini-projects: a dice simulator, number guessing game, and random password generator. Made while studying CS50's Python intro and MIT's 6.0001 course.

These projects are based on Abhay Parashar's https://towardsdatascience.com/10-python-mini-projects-that-everyone-should-build-with-code-769c6f1af0c4

1. 🎲 Dice simulator:
   Prints a random integer between 1 and 6. Added a message when the user input isn't roll or exit.

2. 🔮 Number guessing game:
   Program selects a random integer between 1 and 10, and user has 3 chances to guess the selected number. Added a try-except function to display an error message if the user input is not a 1-10 integer and other game messages.

3. 🔐 Random password generator:
   Generates a random password of the lenght the user input. Changed function random.sample to random.choices to allow passwords longer than the string of all characters.
