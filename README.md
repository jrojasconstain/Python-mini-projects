# Python-mini-projects
Exploring Python with mini-projects: a dice simulator, number guessing game, and random password generator. Made while studying CS50's Intro to Python and MIT's 6.0001 Intro to CS open courses.

These projects are based on Abhay Parashar's https://towardsdatascience.com/10-python-mini-projects-that-everyone-should-build-with-code-769c6f1af0c4

1. 🎲 <b>Dice simulator: </b>
   Prints a random integer between 1 and 6. Added a message when the user input isn't roll or exit.

2. 🔮 <b>Number guessing game: </b>
   Program selects a random integer between 1 and 10, and user has 3 chances to guess the selected number. Added a try-except function to display an error message if the user input is not a 1-10 integer and other game messages.

3. 🔐 <b>Random password generator: </b>
   Generates a random password of the lenght the user input. Changed function random.sample to random.choices to allow passwords longer than the string of all characters.
